Hi, I’m Luigi

My current job is to design, build, deliver and maintain IT systems and their environments.
I started my career in academics and then I moved to the Cloud corporate world mainly working on open-source cloud provisioning tools (OpenStack, Kubernetes, OpenShift).
In my current role I’m a Cloud Consultant with Accenture Spa.
I hold a BSc in Telecommunications Engineering and a Master Degree in Multimedia Signal Processing and Telecommuncations Networks.

Currently I live in Milan with my girlfriend and my son.
After work I enjoy to play sports as tennis and hiking.

I’m skilled in some areas and I’ve learned and studied quite some stuff as well.
My current buzzwords are: k8s devops ansible selenium openshift architecture automation integration
